        "journal": "Radiation and Environmental Biophysics",
        "description": "One of the primary limitations of the recommendations of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group is that it does not consider attenuation effects from individual sources in multi-source brachytherapy implants. To address this issue, the inter-source effect (ISE) parameter has been introduced. In the present study the ISE is evaluated and compared for several ¹²⁵I brachytherapy sources simulating three different ¹²⁵I source models with the Geant4 code. The validity of these models was confirmed by comparing their dosimetric parameters — such as the radial dose and anisotropy functions — with those reported in previous work. The ISE parameters and corresponding attenuation factors (µf) were determined for each source at various distances in a three-source implant configuration. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for inter-source attenuation in clinical dosimetry to prevent dose overestimation, as ISE and µf are highly dependent on factors like source spacing, orientation, and implant geometry, necessitating case-specific calculations for optimal treatment planning. The present study provides critical insights for improving accuracy in dose delivery in brachytherapy, particularly for low-energy ¹²⁵I sources, and underscores the need for careful consideration of source design and configuration in clinical practice.",

        "description": "The objective of the proposed work was focused in presenting a novel algorithm for processing gamma-ray spectra based on theory of wavelet. We discuss the mathematical principles of applying wavelet transform (WT) method in processing γ-ray spectra and removing fluctuations and background from spectrum. The wavelet algorithm can apply accurately to detect most of peaks and determine net area under peaks. The proposed approach is able to detect most weak peaks in the searching processes. Wavelet method with some kind of discretization known as discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been applied to filter noise and background detected with the spectrum. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via simulated spectra with different peaks containing backgrounds and with some measured gamma ray spectra. These analyzed results prove that the proposed DWT routine gives precise results for filtering and removing noise and background.",

While derivation we observed that the fluctuation mechanism suggests that muons and tauons should maintain the idea of classical lepton radius just as electrons maintain the idea of classical electron radius.

The experimental values of the soils μ/ρ were compared with XCOM program calculations and GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations. Total atomic and electronic cross-sections, effective atomic and electron numbers of all soil samples were calculated in a wide energy range (1 keV–100 GeV). The values of these parameters have been found to vary with photon energy and chemical composition of the soil. The variations of these parameters with energy are shown graphically for total photon interactions. The results showed that loamy soils have low photon attenuation parameters than clayey ones for the region of 59.5 keV.",

An appreciable variation in exposure buildup factors for the investigated ODS steel alloys was observed. The exposure buildup factors of ODS alloys were observed strongly depending upon the photon energy, penetration depths and the chemical compositions. The exposure buildup factors were found to be small in low- and high-photon energy whereas these were very large in intermediate-energy region. Our investigation signifies that the Eurofer 97 ODS steel alloy is the superior gamma-ray and neutron shielding materials.

        "description": "Mass attenuation coefficients of various types of building materials were measured using a high-resolution HPGe spectrometer detector. Samples were irradiated by gamma-rays emitted from point sources of 241Am, 133Ba, 60Co and 137Cs. The results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations of XCOM code. The effectiveness of building materials in shielding were determined over the range 50–3000 keV. Finally, the protection efficiency of walls and roofs from radiation exposure were determined. The effectiveness of all tested building materials was better than the internationally accepted limit, and they are therefore acceptable for use.",

        "description": "A package for gamma spectrum analysis (PGSA) was developed using object-oriented Borland C++ design for MS-windows. This package consists of five programs which can be used for gamma-ray spectrum analysis and routine neutron activation analysis. The advantages of PGSA are its simple algorithms and its need for only minimum amount of input information.",
